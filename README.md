# Case-Study-on-Exponentials
# Overview
In this report we aim to investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem. We have generated a thousand simulation with the mean of exponential distribution which is 1/lambda and standard deviation 1/lambda. For all the simulation we have set the lambda = 0.2. Basically we will be investigating the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials.
